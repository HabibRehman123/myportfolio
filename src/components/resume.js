				<h5>About Me</h5>
				<p style={{width:'100%'}}>
				I am currently a fourth-year electrical engineering student at the University of Ottawa with a proven track record of academic excellence and a passion for developing and implementing novel solutions to challenging problems. My thorough knowledge of core electrical engineering concepts, years of experience in laboratory work coupled with execution of multiple complex and rigorous engineering projects has fostered my development into a dynamic, resilient and detail oriented individual. My keen interest in continuous education and personal development has cultivated an interest in software and web development in addition to electrical engineering. Iâ€™m trained on langauges such as Java, C, HTML, CSS, Javascript and React, and continuously complete a host of software projects to showcase and expand my skill-set.
